# IWSLT2022 - Low-resource Speech Translation Track: Tamasheq-French Parallel Corpus

Repository for sharing the data in the Tamasheq language, one of the languages for the low-resource speech translation track at IWSLT 2022.

## Parallel data
This corpus is a collection of radio recordings from [Studio Kalangou](https://www.studiokalangou.org/) translated to French. It comprises 17 hours of clean speech in Tamasheq, translated to the French language. We also make available a 19 hour version of this corpus, including 2 additional hours of data that was labeled by annotators as potentially noisy. Both versions of this dataset share the same validation and test sets. 

## Additional Audio data
In addition to the 17-19 hours of Tamasheq audio data aligned to French translations, and in light of recent work in self-supervised models for speech processing, we also provide participants with unlabaled raw audio data in the Tamasheq language, as well as in other 4 languages spoken in the Republic of the Niger: French (116 hours), Fulfulde (114 hours), Hausa (105 hours), Tamashek (234 hours) and Zarma (100 hours). All this data comes from the radio broadcastings of [Studio Kalangou](https://www.studiokalangou.org/) and [Studio Tamani](https://www.studiotamani.org/).

The participants are not required to use any of this data. 

Due to its size, this data is made available through [this website](https://demo-lia.univ-avignon.fr/studios-tamani-kalangou/).
